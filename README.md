Sample project to test knowledge in `useState` and `useEffect`. The project takes input from the user to store in an array. The array is then displayed as a list of items to pack. The user can add an item, mark items as packed, remove an item, or clear the item list. The app also displays the percentage of items that had already been packed and gives users some sorting options. Check out the [live version](https://travel-list.norugie.me/).
